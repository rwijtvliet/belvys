Example data
============

The package provides a few examples of ``Api`` and ``Structure`` configurations. Most are shown on their respective pages in this documentation, but it is also possible to directly get the class instances or the corresponding configuration files with the following functions.

---------
Structure
---------

To use and play around with these configurations in code, use the ``belvys.example_structure()`` function. It takes a single argument ``"basic"`` or ``"complex"``, and returns a ``Structure`` instance. 

---
Api
---

Likewise, ``belvys.example_api()`` returns an ``Api`` instance. It takes the same argument - though the difference between "basic" and "complex" is much smaller here.
