# Portfolio lines

pflines:

# Here we define the portfolio lines we want to access for each portfolio. (We can make
# portfolio-specific corrections further below.) The keys ("pfline ids") in this section
# can be freely chosen; they point to timeseries names that exist in belvis.

  current_offtake: Offtake volume in MW
  # A pfline id can point to a single timeseries name. The unit of the timeseries is used 
  # to determine what information we have. (In this case, assuming the name is sensible, 
  # this is a volume timeseries, which is used to create a volume-only portfolio line).

  expected_offtake: 
  - Offtake volume in MW
  - Expected churn in MW
  # It can also point to a list of timeseries. In that case, timeseries with the same unit
  # unit are added. In this case, we again obtain a volume-only portfolio line...

  forward_sourced:
  - Procurement forward volume in MW
  - Procurement forward cost in EUR
  # ...and in this case, due to the distinct units, a price-and-volume portfolio line.

portfolios:

# The portfolios we are interested in.
# This section has one part "original", and possibly also a part "sythetic".

  original: 
  - B2C_household
  - B2C_Spot
  - B2B_backtoback
  - B2B_Spot
  # This is a list of portfolio ids that are present in belvis. The list elements are the
  # portfolio ids (or "portfolio abbreviations", or "short names") as they are present in 
  # belvis.

# Prices

prices:

# This section points to where market price timeseries are located in belvis.
# The keys ("price ids") in this section can be freely chosen; each is a dictionary 
# with keys 'pfid' and 'tsnames', indicating the belvis portfolio id and the timeseries 
# name of the price timeseries. Just as above; we can specify a single timeseries, an array
# of timeseries, or a nested structure.

  fwc_monthly_DE:
    pfid: Germany
    tsnames: MPFC (THE)
  # Just as above, we can specify a single timeseries...

  fwc_daily_DE:
    pfid: Germany
    tsnames: 
    - MPFC (THE)
    - M2D profile
  # ...or multiple ones, as long as they are in the same folder.
